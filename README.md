For this assignment, you are going to use C to implement a simulator for the Sequential Y86 architecture. Your input will be a text file that contains first the program counter followed by the memory. A front end is already written that will read this file into an array where each byte of memory is a char. Starting at the memory address given to you as the starting program counter, you will read in bytes and execute the program. This is very similar to what we did in class where we ‘disassembled’ the input and looked at what happens in the different stages for each type of instruction.
